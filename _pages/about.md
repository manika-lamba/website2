## About Me

I am incoming Assistant Professor at the School of Library and Information Studies, University of Oklahoma. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I completed my Ph.D., MPhil, & Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Delhi. Additionally, I have a MS in Plant Biotechnology and BS (H) in Biochemistry. My research focuses on information & knowledge organization and HCI using text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. I have worked extensively with textual data. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus groups, survey and field experiments, and computational approaches.

Currently, I interested in research revolving around critical technological justice, social representation, information policy, and community informatics using computational methods for information & knowledge organization.
